            <p>
                Meet <b>Nigun karthi</b>, an ambitious engineering student hailing from a small town with big dreams. His journey began with a spark of curiosity for machines and technology, inspired by childhood days spent dismantling gadgets to see how they worked. Enrolling in a reputed engineering college, Arjun discovered that the path to success was not as straightforward as solving equations. Late-night coding marathons, caffeine-fueled exam preparations, and group projects with last-minute panic became his reality.
                Amidst the chaos, Arjun found joy in small victories: acing a tough subject, building his first prototype, and securing an internship at a tech giant. Balancing academics, friendships, and endless assignments, he learned resilience, teamwork, and problem-solvingâ€”the true essence of engineering.  
                Today, Arjun is not just an engineer but a dreamer and innovator, driven by the belief that persistence and passion can transform ideas into reality.
